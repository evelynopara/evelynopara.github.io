        <h3>About FGM</h3>
        <p>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) consists of procedures that involve the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia (labia, clitoris, labia minora, labia majora) or cutting and sewing the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM is done to young girls to present them as "clean and pure" to their future husbands. It adds no medical benefit but is done to rather prevent premarital sex. The effects of female genital mutilation include severe bleeding, problems urinating, cysts, infections, and complications during childbirth like increased risk of newborn deaths.</p>

        <p>FGM has severe and long-lasting consequences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Severe Bleeding</li>
          <li>Problems Urinating</li>
          <li>Cysts</li>
          <li>Infections</li>
          <li>Complications during Childbirth: Increased risk of newborn deaths and other obstetric complications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FGM is most prevalent in the Middle East and Africa, but it is also practiced in countries such as India, Indonesia, Jordan, and Malaysia. Despite its widespread practice, there is a growing global movement to end this harmful tradition.</p>

        <p>African womenâ€™s rights defenders are actively fighting to protect females at risk of FGM. Many are working under the Solidarity for African Womenâ€™s Rights Coalition (SOAWR), advocating for systemic changes and community education.</p>
        <h3>International Efforts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In 2020, Burkina Faso submitted a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of the group of African States, calling on governments globally to take comprehensive, multisectoral, and rights-based measures to prevent and eliminate FGM.</li>
          <li>Since 2008, UNFPA and UNICEF have led the largest global program to accelerate the elimination of FGM, focusing on 17 countries in Africa and the Middle East while supporting regional and global initiatives.</li>
          <li>On December 20, 2012, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on the nations of the world to eliminate FGM, emphasizing the need for global cooperation and commitment.</li>
